The game uses discrete inputs (button up/down state) and continuous inputs (mouse positions, button down duration etc.)
Player uses arrow keys to control sandwich
The player must use a physics-based interaction to achieve the goal in each core gameplay scene (e.g. get certain objects to collide)
Breadknives, bounce across screen, when they collide with player it ends the game, also player collides with coins, increasing the score
The game contains 3+ distinct core gameplay scenes
Title Screen, Level Select, Lvl1, Lvl2, Lvl3
Additional scenes are inserted between core gameplay scenes to add context
N/A
Additional Notes:
There is a bug that prevents player from switching character, and even after the player changes level the same background image is used.
I tried to fix it but unfortunately any change would break my game.
